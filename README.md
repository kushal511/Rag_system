RAG System on “Leave No Context Behind” Paper
This project involves building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using the LangChain framework to connect a Large Language Model (LLM) with external data sources, allowing it to generate highly accurate and contextually relevant responses. The system is designed to leverage the latest advancements in LLMs, such as Google’s Gemini 1.5 Pro, while integrating specific, company-related information from external sources like PDFs and text files.

Project Overview:
The LLMs, despite their capabilities, often lack access to specific company-related information that is not part of their training data. This information, however, is often available in documents such as PDFs, text files, and other proprietary resources. By connecting the LLM to these external data sources, the model can generate responses that are much more relevant and accurate for specialized applications.

In this project, I built a RAG system designed to answer questions about the “Leave No Context Behind” paper, published by Google on April 10th, 2024. The system retrieves relevant sections of the paper and uses them as context when generating responses, thereby significantly improving the accuracy of the answers.

Key Features:
LLM Integration:

Used Google’s Gemini 1.5 Pro LLM as the core model for generating responses.
Enhanced the LLM’s performance by connecting it to external data sources, allowing it to provide contextually relevant and accurate answers.

Data Source Connection:

Integrated the “Leave No Context Behind” paper as an external data source.
Utilized the LangChain framework to connect the LLM with this document, ensuring that the model has access to the most up-to-date and relevant information.

Document Processing:

Loaded the Rag_Leave_no_context_behind_research_paper.pdf using PyPDFLoader, a tool designed for efficient PDF processing.
The document was split into manageable chunks, making it easier for the model to process and retrieve relevant information.

Chunk Embedding and Storage:

Created embeddings for each document chunk using state-of-the-art techniques, ensuring that the semantic meaning of each chunk was captured accurately.
Stored these embeddings in a vector database, which allows for efficient retrieval of relevant chunks when the LLM needs context for generating responses.

Retriever Object Creation:

Converted the CHROMA DB connection into a retriever object, which the LLM uses to access the stored embeddings.
This retriever object plays a critical role in the RAG system, as it allows the LLM to fetch and utilize the most relevant information during the generation step.

Response Generation:

When a query is made, the system retrieves the relevant chunks from the vector store and passes them to the LLM.
The LLM then generates a response that is not only accurate but also deeply informed by the content of the “Leave No Context Behind” paper.
